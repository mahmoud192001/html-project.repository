[4] In addition to that The most important types of operating systems are also used as a single system that uses a multi-tasking system. This system is characterized by its ability to implement more than one program simultaneously. Operating systems The distributed system, which is a system that manages a group of different computers and makes them look like one computer, and one of the operating systems used is also the real-time system. It is a specialized system that executes operations and data in a timely manner</p> </font>
