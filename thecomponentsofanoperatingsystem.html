 <font face="Times New Roman" size="+2" color="black"> All the different operating systems contain basic components, none of which are indispensable. They work together in an integrated manner to achieve the desired purpose of the system. The components of the computer operating system are summarized as follows:

Operations Management System
The Operations Management Program is one of the components of the computer's operating system and is responsible for choosing the optimal process that must be implemented to handle commands coming from the user when running different programs, and then executing these operations, as it is responsible for managing communication between different processes, synchronizing different processes, and canceling operations , And others,

Memory management system
It is the program responsible for preserving the data required to save it, managing it and saving its locations so that it can access them if requested, as it manages memory spaces as required, and re-arranges the data according to the user's requirements, and there is a part of the memory management program responsible for allocating memory units for different programs , Or freeing memory modules from the data in case the user no longer needs it, so these modules become empty and reusable.

I / O management system
The input and output device management system is an important component of the computer's operating system, as its function is to send and receive data and commands through various input and output devices such as keyboard, mouse, printer, monitor, USB devices, disk drives, headphones, amplifiers, and others.

File system
The file system is a component of the computer's operating system and is the part responsible for arranging and storing data in a volume such as a hard disk, as it manages it and determines how it is accessed, and hence is responsible for organizing the content of the volume.

Network management system
The network management system is a component of the computer's operating system and is responsible for communicating with different networks, defining communication methods and strategies, routing strategies, and organizing the process of data transfer and various processes.

user interface
The user interface is one of the components of the computer's operating system, which is the place where the interaction between the user and the computer is carried out, so that the user can control the device and send commands, as the device displays results, required information, etc. on the user interface so that the user can benefit from these results.

Protection system
The security system is a component of the computer's operating system and is responsible for protecting device components such as CPU, volumes, files, and devices, and is responsible for users â€™personal accounts.

How the operating system works
When the computer is turned on, the BIOS connects to the boot loader and loads it, after which the boot loader calls the kernel and loads it to the random storage memory, the kernel begins receiving the commands that the user sends through the command receiver, which in turn translates all the commands into the machine language, then the kernel reads the command and sends To the appropriate chip in the processor and after processing the output, the output is sent to the kernel, which in turn sends the output to the libraries, and then these outputs appear to the user in the form of sound or image.</p></font>
